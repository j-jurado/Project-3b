General Structure

Red-Black Tree:
-Has internal channel struct
-Supports inserting new nodes (channels) w/ self-balancing
-Supports removing nodes w/ self-balancing
-Supports search by various types (sub count, vid count, country, etc…) with node return type

B-Tree:
-Has internal channel struct
-Supports inserting new nodes (channels) w/ self-balancing
-Supports removing nodes w/ self-balancing
-Supports search by various types (sub count, vid count, country, etc…) with node return type

Main:
-Parses CSV file into both data structures
-Create interface to search and view channel stats
-Display desired information
-Implement SFML graphics
-Record and display times to compare the performance of each tree
